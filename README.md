# Proxy (squid) and VPN (pptp) setup

This is just shell script to setup proxy and vpn on Sakura VPS.
Main target user is who lives outside of Japan and expects to browse restricted sites.
Even non restricted site would have better performance by avoiding unnecessary routing.

## Actual scenario
* Watch ondemand TV (except Netflix and hulu. Amazon is not tested yet). Gyao works.
* Z-kai online study with better streaming performance.
